I have taught undergraduate courses on the economics of international finance and microeconomics. I am currently teaching a graduate course in heterodox approaches to economics. I also served as a teaching assistant for graduate-level and introductory economics courses at CSU. In addition, I was a teaching assistant for several undergraduate and graduate courses at the University of São Paulo.
