I have served as the instructor of record for several undergraduate courses, including international economics and finance, intermediate microeconomics, and the history of economic thought, as well as a *PhD-level course* on heterodox approaches to economics. Currently, I am teaching intermediate microeconomics and the history of economic thought for undergraduate students. Additionally, I have worked as a teaching assistant for both graduate and introductory economics courses at CSU, and for various undergraduate and graduate courses at the University of São Paulo.
