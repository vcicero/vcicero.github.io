I am an Assistant Professor of [Global Commerce](https://denison.edu/academics/global-commerce) at Denison University. I received my Ph.D. in Economics from [Colorado State University](https://economics.colostate.edu/) and hold both a master's and bachelor's degree from the [University of São Paulo (USP)](https://www.fea.usp.br/economia), my *alma mater*.  

My research lies at the intersection of international trade and economic development. I combine applied microeconomic methods with macroeconomic theory to address policy-relevant questions. Much of my current work investigates the consequences of trade-induced economic shocks for development outcomes such as structural change, electoral outcomes, mortality, and crime. I have published in the *Journal of Development Economics*, *Health Economics*, *The B.E. Journal of Economic Analysis & Policy*, *Metroeconomica*, and *Structural Change and Economic Dynamics*. Details on my ongoing projects can be found on the [research](research) page.
