Welcome to my website. I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Economics](https://economics.colostate.edu/) at Colorado State University. I will be joining Denison University as an Assistant Professor in August 2025.

Before coming to CSU, I earned my master’s degree from the [Department of Economics](https://www.fea.usp.br/economia) at the University of São Paulo (USP) in 2020, where I also completed my bachelor’s degree in 2018.

My primary research interests focus on international trade and economic development. I use a combination of applied microeconomic methods and macroeconomic theory to address policy-relevant questions. My current research focuses particularly on the impact of trade shocks on various facets of development, including, for instance, structural change, mortality, and crime outcomes. My academic work has been published in *Health Economics* and *Structural Change and Economic Dynamics*, and you can find more information about my ongoing projects on the [research](research) page.

Teaching has played a central role in my life over the past few years. You can find details about my teaching experience, both as an instructor and a teaching assistant, at Colorado State University and previously at the University of São Paulo, on the [teaching](teaching) page.

For office hours in the Spring semester, please access this [page](https://cal.com/vcicero).
