Before coming to CSU, I received my masters' degree from the [Department of Economics](https://www.fea.usp.br/economia) at the University of SÃ£o Paulo (USP) in 2020, where I also got my bachelors' degree in 2018. 

My primary research interests focus on international trade and economic development. My academic work has been [published](publications) in
