Welcome to my website. I am a PhD student in the [Department of Economics](https://economics.colostate.edu/) at Colorado State University. Before coming to CSU, I received my masters' degree from the [Department of Economics](https://www.fea.usp.br/economia) at the University of São Paulo (USP) in 2020, where I also got my bachelors' degree in 2018. 

My primary research interests focus on international trade and economic development. My academic work has been published in
*Structural Change and Economic Dynamics* and you can find more information about ongoing projects in the [research](research) page.

Teaching has been a fundamental part of my life in the previous years. You can find more information about my teaching experience, both as an instructor and a teaching assitant, at Colorado State University and previously at the University of São Paulo in the [teaching](teaching) page.

For office hours in the Fall semester, please access this [page](https://cal.com/vcicero).
