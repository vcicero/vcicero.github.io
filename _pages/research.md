Functional distribution of income as a determinant of importing behavior: An empirical analysis (with Gilberto Tadeu Lima), *Structural Change and Economic Dynamics* 65 (2023), 393–405. [Published Version](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.strueco.2023.03.008){: .btn--research} [WP Version](/files/pdf/research/wp_cicerolima.pdf){: .btn--research} [Online Appendix](/files/pdf/research/oappendix_cicerolima.pdf){: .btn--research}

> We examine the dynamic impact of the functional distribution of income on the demand for imports in developed and developing countries. Drawing upon a motivating accounting structure suggesting a potentially causal effect of the functional distribution of income in an extended version of a standard import function, we find evidence that a fall in the wage share has a statistically significant positive (negative) impact on the volume of imports in developing (developed) countries and the entire sample of countries. Therefore, the neglect of such income distribution effects in import demand functions represents the omission of both an empirically relevant variable and a further theoretically significant structural channel through which the functional distribution of income affects output growth. A key implication is that the impact of the functional distribution of income on the demand for imports has to be considered in growth empirics based on either a binding balance-of-payments constraint in the Kaldor–Thirlwall tradition or a demand-led regime approach or a competitive real exchange rate.

Trade Liberalization and Mortality Rates: Evidence of Pro-Cyclical Mortality from Brazil (with [Lucas Corrêa-Dias](https://lucasccdias.github.io/) and Sammy Zahran). Revised and Resubmitted to *Health Economics* [PDF](/files/pdf/research/manuscript_Trade_Mortality_CDZ_wp.pdf){: .btn--research}

> We trace the evolution of all-cause mortality rates in Brazilian regions with varying exposure to trade-induced economic shocks before, during, and after liberalization reforms in the 1990s. We find consistent evidence of pro-cyclical mortality, with areas more exposed to tariff reductions experiencing larger declines in mortality across varying time horizons. The observed decline in mortality rates is evident across sex, age groups, and for both internal and external causes of mortality. We falsify the observed relationship between mortality and tariff reductions with analyses of causes of death that are plausibly unrelated to economic activity. Concerning proximate mechanisms involved in our finding of pro-cyclical mortality, we show that healthcare infrastructure expanded in local economies more affected by the trade-induced economic shock. This expansion was characterized by the increased capital-intensity of care, facilitated by the import of diagnostic technologies that reduce mortality from internal causes. We also find supporting evidence for the idea that pro-cyclical mortality is partially caused by a decrease in transport and non-transport-related accidents. Overall, our findings highlight an underappreciated dimension of trade policy effects, namely public health.

Fiscal Consolidation, Crowding Out, and the Social Safety Net: Evidence from the Budget Control Act of 2011 (with [Tim Komarek](https://sites.google.com/site/timkomarek/))  [PDF](/files/pdf/research/Komarek&Cicero_BCA.pdf){:.btn--research}

> In mid-2011 political debate on the appropriate level of federal spending and growing federal deficits climaxed with a showdown over raising the debt ceiling. This led to the Budget Control Act of 2011, which resulted in a steep decline in federal discretionary spending. In this paper, we leverage the institutional details from the Budget Control Act of 2011 to examine how the contraction in federal procurement contracts with private-sector firms impacted the social safety net. Our results show that every dollar reduction of federal procurement spending was offset by a 0.06 increase in unemployment insurance compensation and less than 0.01 increase in food assistance. We also show that the local labor market effects of consolidation depend on the sectors receiving federal dollars. Notably, reductions in procurement in industries with high labor intensity resulted in more pronounced local expansions in the social safety net. Finally, we examine how individuals in different demographic groups receive social safety net program benefits following a local economic shock. For instance, younger people and less educated individuals were more likely to receive food assistance, while none of our demographic groups saw an increase in disability. These findings have implications both for understanding regional economic development and for improving regional resiliency to negative demand shocks.

Donkey business: trade, resource exploitation, and crime (with [Lucas Corrêa-Dias](https://lucasccdias.github.io/))  [PDF](https://osf.io/preprints/osf/qreum){: .btn--research}

>The growing demand for *ejiao*, a traditional Chinese medicine product derived from donkey hides, has sparked a global trade that profoundly impacts donkey populations and local economies in low and middle-income countries. In response to the pressing issue of burgeoning populations of stray and abandoned donkeys, Brazil implemented regulatory measures governing the export of these animals to China in 2017. This paper examines the intricate relationship between regulation of a natural resource-based contestable market -- in which property rights are not well-defined -- and local crime rates, focusing on the donkey hide trade in Brazil. Employing a quasi-experimental research design, we leverage the timing of the regulatory measures alongside variations in donkey occurrences per inhabitant across Brazilian municipalities to provide compelling evidence that the surge in *ejiao* demand has led to an increase in crime and violence within Brazil. These findings underscore the critical importance of nuanced market regulation to mitigate potential social costs in markets lacking well-defined property rights. Furthermore, they highlight the urgent need for robust monitoring and enforcement frameworks to address pressing issues such as the predatory exploitation of donkey populations on a global scale.

Institutional changes, effective demand and inequality: a structuralist model of secular stagnation (with [Daniele Tavani](https://www.danieletavani.com/)) [PDF](/files/pdf/research/SecularStagnation_CT_draft.pdf){:.btn--research}

>This paper addresses the factors driving economic stagnation and inequality in the US over recent decades. We study a demand-driven model with joint adjustment of the functional distribution and capacity utilization in the short run, and explore the dynamics of wealth accumulation and labor productivity growth in the long run. Our analysis formally explains several stylized facts observed in the US economy: the decline in labor share of income, the increase in the top 1% wealth share, the slowdown in labor productivity growth, and the reduction in the income-capital ratio. Institutional changes that weakened workers' bargaining power or strengthened firms' market power have reduced the labor share of income. While these changes may have initially stimulated short-term economic activity and growth within a profit-led demand regime, their long-term effects are concerning. In particular, a lower labor share negatively impacts labor productivity growth and, in turn, slows down the growth rate of the economy in the long run. To achieve balanced growth, the income-capital ratio, proxied by the rate of capacity utilization, must eventually decrease. The long-run behavior of our model is captured by a simple 2D dynamical system analyzing the capitalist wealth share and the labor share. Our findings demonstrate that an institutionally driven decline in the labor share exacerbates wealth inequality over time. These results point to the importance of policies counterbalancing the labor-crushing developments of the past decades to escape the process of stagnation and inequality.
