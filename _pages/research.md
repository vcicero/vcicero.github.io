Resource boom, export composition, concentration, and sophistication: evidence from Brazilian local economies. Job Market Paper. Submitted [PDF](/files/pdf/research/RB_JMP_Cicero_draft.pdf){: .btn--research}

> This paper investigates the impact of resource booms on export value, concentration, composition, and sophistication in resource-rich developing economies. Using a shift-share instrument that leverages heterogeneous exposure to Chinese demand after China’s 2001 WTO accession and the *ex-ante* composition of export baskets, I examine the causal effects on export baskets and sectoral employment of Brazilian local economies. The findings reveal increased export values and concentration in more exposed regions, with a shift from resource-based manufactures to primary products and declining export sophistication. Despite wage growth in primary and service sectors, primary employment remained stable while manufacturing jobs contracted, resembling a Dutch disease pattern. These results underscore the trade-offs of resource booms, where short-term gains in export value and sectoral wages may be offset by long-term development challenges. Given Brazil's similarities to other commodity exporters, these findings may indicate similar trends emerging across developing economies.

Donkey business: trade, resource exploitation, and crime (with [Lucas Corrêa-Dias](https://lucasccdias.github.io/)) Revision requested at *Journal of the European Economic Association* [PDF](https://osf.io/preprints/osf/qreum){: .btn--research}

>This paper examines the relationship between the institutionalization of a renewable resource market with poorly defined property rights and local crime rates. We focus on the regulation of the donkey hide trade in Brazil, driven by foreign demand for *ejiao*, a Traditional Chinese Medicine product. Using a quasi-experimental research design, we leverage the timing of regulatory measures alongside spatial variations in donkey populations across Brazilian municipalities to provide causal evidence that the slaughtering of free-roaming donkeys led to an increase in crime and violence. We further explore the role of market illegality, finding that the impact on crime was twice as large during periods when the trade was illegal in Brazil. Our results carry important policy implications for developing countries grappling with resource booms and weak property rights. These findings emphasize the need for effective regulation, robust monitoring, and enforcement mechanisms to mitigate the social costs associated with natural resource exploitation.

Declining Federal Spending and the Social Safety Net: Evidence from the Budget Control Act of 2011 (with [Tim Komarek](https://sites.google.com/site/timkomarek/)) Submitted [PDF](/files/pdf/research/bca_kc.pdf){:.btn--research}

> In 2011 political debate on federal spending and growing federal deficits climaxed with a showdown over raising the debt ceiling. This led to the Budget Control Act of 2011, which resulted in a steep decline in federal discretionary spending. We leverage the institutional details from the Budget Control Act to examine how the contraction in federal procurement contracts with private-sector firms impacted individuals and the social safety net. Our results show procurement reductions in industries with high labor intensity resulted in more pronounced local social safety net expansions. We also examine heterogeneity by demographic groups.

How much is fiscal consolidation offset by increases in social safety net spending? Evidence from the 2011 Budget Control Act (with [Tim Komarek](https://sites.google.com/site/timkomarek/) and Kendall Stephenson) Revision requested at *The B.E. Journal of Economic Analysis and Policy* [PDF](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4915048){:.btn--research}

> This paper investigates how much reductions in federal procurement spending from the Budget Control Act of 2011 are offset or “crowded out” by increases in spending on social safety net programs. We use a shift-share instrumental variables approach and find that approximately 7% of the cuts in federal spending are offset by social safety net transfers. Specifically, for every dollar reduced in federal procurement, there is an associated increase of 0.06 in unemployment insurance payments and less than 0.01 in SNAP benefits. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that these effects vary significantly with the type of spending that is cut. These findings underscore the broader implications of fiscal adjustments, highlighting the potential consequences for state policies and employer costs.
